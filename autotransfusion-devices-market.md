<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autotransfusion Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On Pump Transfusion Devices</li><li>Off Pump transfusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The autotransfusion devices market is primarily segmented into on-pump and off-pump transfusion devices. On-pump transfusion devices are utilized during surgeries where blood is collected and reinfused while the patient's heart is still being supported by a heart-lung machine, ensuring continuous circulation. Off-pump transfusion devices, on the other hand, operate in surgeries without the use of such machinery, allowing for blood recovery and reinfusion directly from the surgical site. Both types enhance patient outcomes by minimizing blood loss and reducing the need for donor blood.</p></p>
